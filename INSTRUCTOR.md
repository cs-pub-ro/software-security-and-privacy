# Instructor Checklist

These are checklist items for instructors.
To make note of and to use before, during and after sessions.

## Terminology

We use the following terms:

* **Learner**: A student or participant who actively takes part in a session.
* **Instructor**: The teacher, teaching assistant, mentor, or other educator responsible for delivering the session.
* **Session**: A teaching unit focused on a particular topic.
  Its materials are stored in a dedicated directory and delivered during an allocated time slot.
* **Live session**: The real-time, interactive delivery of a session.
* **Lab session**: A practical session in which learners develop and practice skills by completing exercises individually or in teams.
* **Exercise**: A practical, actionable unit of work.
  Each exercise has its own subdirectory within the session directory.
* **Lecture session**: A primarily instructor-led session in which learners generally participate as an audience.
  Its purpose is to introduce and explain concepts related to the session topic.

## Lab Sessions

1. **Prepare and test the lab**

   * Work through the entire lab contents from the perspective of a learner.
   * Confirm that all exercises are solvable using the documented environment.
   * Check that commands, code, scripts, tools, repositories, and other resources are available.
   * Verify that the instructions are accurate, complete, and easy to follow.
   * Test the "checking your work" instructions for each exercise.
   * Identify likely errors, points of confusion, and prerequisite knowledge.
   * Confirm how learners can reset or restore their environment if necessary.
   * Check that potentially destructive commands are clearly identified and explained.

1. **Review the instructor documentation**

   * Read the `INSTRUCTOR.md` file for the session.
   * Read the `INSTRUCTOR.md` files in the exercise directories.
   * Identify the essential learning objectives and the key points that should be reached.
   * Review the expected solution, validation procedure, common mistakes, and suggested explanations.
   * Note optional extension activities, such as `FURTHER.md`, for learners who finish early.

1. **Do a session intro**

    * Do a 5 minutes intro into the lab session.
    * Present session objectives and a summary of the exercises: demo, core exercises, bonus exercises.
    * Remind learners about the lab setup, to use the setup check script to be sure all is OK.
    * Ask students to open up the lab session page and download the session archive.
    * Ask learners to prepare the work environment for the demo exercise(s).
    * Aim to start the demo exercise(s) at `XY:10` the latest.

1. **Begin with demo exercises**

   * Start with demo exercises to be completed jointly by you, the instructor, and the learners.
   * Limit the demonstration to approximately half of the lab, and preferably no more than 50 minutes.
   * Have learners perform the steps themselves rather than merely watch.
   * Ensure that learners:
     * enter commands;
     * write or modify code;
     * run programs;
     * inspect output and errors;
     * validate the result;
     * ask and answer questions.
   * Explain the reasoning behind each step, not only the commands or code.
   * Use the demo to model good practices, including checking assumptions, reading errors, and debugging systematically.

1. **Support learner-paced work**

   * Allow learners to work at different speeds.
   * Prioritize understanding and skill development over completing an identical number of exercises.
   * Encourage learners to complete all required exercises where reasonably possible.
   * Avoid taking control of the learner's keyboard or completing the exercise for them.
   * Ask learners to explain what they are doing and what result they expect.
   * Offer bonus exercises to learners who finish the required work early.
   * Direct learners who complete the bonus work to the relevant `FURTHER.md` material or other extension activities.

1. **Remain active and supportive**

   * Circulate or monitor the learners throughout the lab.
   * Encourage questions and experimentation.
   * Check in with learners who appear stuck, disengaged, or significantly ahead.
   * Ask periodic questions to assess understanding.
   * Make time for learners who need additional explanation.
   * Maintain a patient, respectful, and positive attitude.
   * Use enthusiasm and relevant examples to make difficult or unfamiliar topics approachable.

1. **Encourage productive collaboration**

   * Encourage learners to discuss concepts, compare approaches, and help one another.
   * Ensure that each learner performs and understands their own work.
   * Do not allow collaboration to become uncritical copying.

1. **Live labs are for learning**

   * We focus on the learning aspect of a live session, not on grading.
   * There should be as little discussions as possible related to lab grading, or anything else.
     The standard saying should be "let's work".
   * By default, learners receive the full grade when they participate actively and make a genuine effort.
   * You can reduce learners' grade when they consistently do not work, do not participate, or cannot demonstrate any genuine engagement with the lab.
   * Do not reduce the grade merely because a learner works slowly or completes fewer exercises than others.

1. **Validate and track completed work**

   * Ask the learner to demonstrate the result using the exercise's checking procedure.
   * Confirm that the solution works.
   * Record the learner's progress in the session record.
   * Progress tracking is not related to grading.
     We do progress tracking for two reasons:
     1. to confirm the exercise was successfully completed (and validated)
     1. to assess the relative difficulty of the lab session by numbering the completed exercises

1. **Preparation outside the lab**

   * Encourage learners to review concepts or prepare questions before the lab.
   * During the live session, learners work on contents only within the lab.
     Any work done home is not relevant, they have to start from scratch.

1. **Conduct a wrap-up**

   * Stop work at XY:45.
     Have 5 minutes for the final discussions.
   * Summarize the main concepts and practical techniques.
   * Explain what learners should review before the next session.
   * Answer final questions or record them for follow-up.

1. **Collect feedback and record issues**

   * Record technical problems, unclear instructions, and recurring misconceptions.
   * Collect brief learner feedback about difficulty, pacing, instructions, and the environment.
   * Report issues in the designated feedback document.

## CTF Lab Sessions

Most lab tasks are capture-the-flag challenges, and need a deployment ready before the session starts.

1. **Deploy the challenges before the lab**

   * Follow the session `-full/INSTRUCTOR.md` and each challenge's `deploy/README.md`.
   * Set this year's flags at deploy time; the `flag` files in the repository are placeholders and are never deployed as they are.
   * Run each challenge's `solve/` against the deployment and check that it prints the deployed flag.
   * Check that the challenges are listed on the CTF platform, in the session's category.

1. **Point learners at the platform, not at the servers**

   * Learners find the address of a deployed challenge on the CTF platform and submit flags there.
   * Server addresses never go in a `README.md`.

1. **Tear down after the lab**

   * Stop the deployments that are not kept up for take-home work.
   * Record any challenge that misbehaved in the feedback document, with the challenge name and what happened.
