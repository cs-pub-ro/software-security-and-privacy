# Rules for Content

Most of the Markdown rules below are enforced by markdownlint, see the *Linting* section of the [repository README](README.md).

## Markdown

* Use `*` instead of `-` as a way to list items in unordered lists
* Make sure each ordered or unordered list is preceded and succeded by an empty line.
* For easy updating of repository contents, each sentence should be on one line and one line only.
  That is, if a paragraph consists of 4 sentences, we would have 4 lines, with a line for each sentence.
  Each sentences is on its own line, starting from the beginning of the line.
  Be sure to indent properly sentences belonging to a list item (for proper rendering).
* For commands, use the `console` format type, instead of `bash`.
  `bash` is to be used only when listing shell scripts.
  For commands, the format is "```console" instead of "```bash".
* Every code block opening fence is preceded by a blank line.
  Every code block closing fence is succeded by a blank line.
  No blank lines immediately after the open fence.
  No blank lines immediately before the closing fence.
* Make sure there are no trailing whitespaces in each line.
* Each snippet / code block should have a type (a name after the triple backticks), such as "```console" or "```C" or "```python" or "```text".
  If there is no predefined format, use "```text".
* For ordered list items, only use `1.` to number items.
  Markdown rendering engine will increment the number appropriately.
  And it's more maintainable: we only use `1.`; when inserting a new item we will use `1.`; otherwise we would have to do renumbering.
* For ordered and unordered list items make sure there is exactly one space between the list items preffix (`1.` for ordered lists and `*` for unordered lists) and the contents of the list item.
* When you have a list of items as bold topical items (such as **Tools**, **Platform**) be sure to either mark them as unordered list items or separate them with a blank line.
  Otherwise, they will be rendered all in one line.
  Markdown rendering engines coallesce sequential lines in the Markdown file (i.e. not separated by a blank line) into a single rendered line.
